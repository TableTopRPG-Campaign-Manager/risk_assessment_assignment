# risk_assessment_assignment
An assignment from alchemy to determine risk points in the "new" tech that we plan on using for our final project. New tech meaning any languages, frameworks, or libraries that we haven't received instruction from Alchemy. 


# Risk 1 Styling:
# Chakra, BootStrap, or Material UI
In this project, in the interest of simplicity I intend to implement on of these CSS libraries. Through an assignment I did in module Two I worked with Tailwind and found that I was unimpressed with the rigidity of its options. I currently have no experience with any of the three. 
 # Mitigation:
I have a mock up of a character sheet input I built recently using react and basic CSS files. I intend to remove the CSS properties from the character sheet and attempt to restructure it using each of the three. 
 # Time Box:
 30 Minutes each. 
 # Failure Plan:
 Ultimately if I absolutely hate all of them I will simply use basic CSS, however I intend to use which ever one I like better of the three. 

 # Risk 2 Reactive/Interactive UI:
 # React DnD, Paralax
 I would like to have a few elements of this project showcase a reactive UI in some way. I have 0 experience with either of these libraries or with using libraries like this. 
# Mitigation:
Using the mockup of the character sheet input, I will test both libraries to determine their ease of use and how well I like the effects. Both perform different tasks and I may choose to implement parts of both.
# Time Box:
 1 Hour each
 # Failure Plan:
 Should I not like either or find that I am unable to implement them in a useful way I will drop the desire for the reactive design.

 # Risk 3 Realtime:
 # webSockets, signalR, or Socket.io
 A major component of this project will be the ability for the GM to request data from players witht he press of a button and then not need to worry about inputing the results. To do this I intend to implement a "live chat" like feature to the encounters that will allow the GM to make the request for data and the players to be alerted to it. Then when the player has input the requested data have the application automatically update the state.
 # Mitigation: 
 In the past we have used Supabase to enable realtime in a chat application. I intend to build an incredibly simple "chat" application using Socket.io, if that fails I will switch to signalR, if that fails then I will switch to webSockets. 
 # Time Box:
 1 hour each, unless Socket.io is easy, then jus tone hour total. 
 # Failure Plan: 
 Lie down, try not to cry, cry. Then use polling to give the illusion of realtime. 
 # Failure Plan Failure Plan:
 Pivot to a GM only application that allows for the management of state with manual inputs for player responses.
